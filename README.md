### What Was Done:

#### Auction webpage layout:
- âœ… **General setup**:
  - Fonts, global styles, and project-specific styles were connected.
  - Semantic containers were created for the page: header, main block with sections (cover, cards, auction information), and footer.

- âœ… **Header**:
  - The logo is centered using CSS Grid.
  - A custom menu was implemented using `list-style: circle` for dividers.
  - An address block was added with semantic tags `<address>` and `<a>` for contact details.

- âœ… **Cover Section**:
  - A section with a background was implemented, overlaid with a semi-transparent overlay.
  - The heading was styled using various `letter-spacing` values and nested `<span>` elements for fine-tuned spacing.
  - The subtitle and button were aligned using Flexbox.

- âœ… **Cards Section**:
  - A list of cards was created using semantic `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.
  - Each card is a link containing an `<article>` element with content and an overlay inside.
  - Sizes and behavior of the cards were configured using Flexbox, including wrapping to the next row.

- âœ… **"About the Auction" Section**:
  - A two-column layout was implemented: the left column contains a circular logo, and the right column contains text with two paragraphs.
  - The right column's heading is aligned with the center of the logo in the left column.

- âœ… **Footer**:
  - A reusable `<address>` block was used for contact details.
  - The central column was styled as a list of links aligned to the center.
  - The right column contains a list of social media links with icons.

### **Highlighted Project Requirements**:
- Use of semantic HTML5 markup (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- Application of CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design.
- Connecting global styles through a CSS file.
- Implementation of responsiveness using Flexbox (wrapping cards to the next row).
- Managing spacing, text, and element alignment.
- Using `z-index` for layering (overlays and background images).
- Styling fonts, including `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing`.
